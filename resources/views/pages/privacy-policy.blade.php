    <h3>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USERS</h3>
    <p>The Site is directed at teachers and school administrators, is not targeted toward children, and does not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.<br>General visitors may provide
        us with PII such as their name and email address when contacting us to learn more about our products.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Registered users of our online services, such as schools and school districts, may provide us with roster
        data, which includes the names of teachers, the relevant classes and the names of students in each of those
        classes. Activate Learning does not receive other forms of PII. &nbsp;The site does not request or require
        email addresses from students using our online application.</p>
    <p>In the course of using our application, registered student users may provide us with answers to
        investigations and quizzes in the form of written text, drawings, links to images or links to videos
        (collectively, "Student Data").</p>
    <p>Access to Student Data is controlled by the school or district. Teachers and administrators are allowed to
        access student responses. Student responses cannot be shared with other students. Activate Learning helps
        schools to securely manage and store Student Data on behalf of our school customers. Activate Learning never
        shares Student Data with third-parties, nor does it market products or services directly to students.</p>
    <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY</h3>
    <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever visitors interact with this Site. For example,
        like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser
        accesses this Site. Activate Learning uses cookies to track non-personal information such as type of
        browser, operating system, domain names and IP addresses. Your browser has settings to control the
        acceptance of cookies, including preventing your browser from accepting cookies, providing notification when
        cookies are received, or disabling cookies completely.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to the use of cookies, this Site may use other commercially available analytical tools, such as
        Google Analytics, to obtain aggregated or de-identified data regarding usage of the features of this Site
        and any content accessed through this Site, including without limitation information regarding web browsers
        used to access this Site, IP addresses, pages visited and time spent on particular pages. Activate Learning
        collects this information to assist in administering the Site and analyzing traffic patterns on the Site for
        internal business purposes. This information is not personally identifiable.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we send occasional emails in HTML format to current and prospective customers. These emails use
        technological methods such as "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) to determine whether a recipient has opened
        or forwarded our emails and/or clicked on links in those emails. These technological methods may enable us
        to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable, such as an email address. If you
        do not want such information collected from HTML emails, or do not wish to receive such emails, you can
        request a change by contacting us directly.</p>
    <h3>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h3>
    <p>The Site may include links to other websites, however by doing so we assume no responsibility for the
        information practices of those websites. Links to other sites do not imply affiliation or endorsement of any
        kind. This Policy does not address, and Activate Learning is not responsible for, the privacy, information
        or other practices of such third parties, including any third party operating any service which links to an
        Activate Learning product or service.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We may share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personal information to authorized business
            partners for research purposes or to assist in understanding the usage and demographic patterns in
            connection with certain programs, content, services and/or functionality of the Site.
        </li>
        <li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if
            required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state
            and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.
        </li>
        <li>Activate Learning reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or
            non-personally-identifiable information that Activate Learning believes, in good faith, is appropriate
            or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
            itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to
            protect the security or integrity of the Site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety
            of Activate Learning, our users or others.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>SECURITY PRACTICES</h3>
    <p>Activate Learning takes user privacy and data security seriously. We use commercially reasonable, industry
        standard measures to safeguard personal information in its possession against loss, theft, unauthorized use,
        or disclosure. Steps taken to secure student data include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any sensitive online information is transmitted over secure, encrypted channels via HTTPS. Sensitive
            information is not transmitted over email.
        </li>
        <li>All student data are stored on secure servers utilizing firewall technology and are only accessible via
            HTTPS and with proper authentication.
        </li>
        <li>If student data needs to be copied to a local machine for providing customer support, the data is always
            password protected, and is immediately deleted from the local machine upon completion of the support
            task.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>Activate Learning does not share student information with any third parties. If a school requests that
            student data should be sent to a third party, Activate Learning sends the data to the school and never
            directly to the third party.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DATA BREACH RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>In the event Activate Learning discovers or is notified of a data breach, we will, as required by applicable
        federal and state laws, investigate, take steps to mitigate the potential impact, and provide notice of the
        breach to applicable agencies, and customers. However, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect
        and we assume no responsibility for any breaches.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Activate Learning maintains a written Information Security Policy which details specific steps the company
        will take in the event of a data breach to validate the breach, end the breach, and notify affected parties,
        as appropriate.</p>
    <h3>SAFE USE OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
    <p>School districts play an important role in ensuring a secure learning environment for students. The following
        is a list of practices a school district can undertake to secure their learning environment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Closely Manage Access – Activate Learning relies on staff and student directories managed by the
            district. Districts then determine which staff members can access student rosters. To maintain proper
            control, districts need to keep this information up-to-date.
        </li>
        <li>Maintain Password Security – Like most online systems, Activate Learning is accessed with a password.
            Students and teachers need to choose secure passwords, and should never share their passwords with
            others.
        </li>
        <li>Properly Secure Devices – Computer devices that lack up-to-date anti-virus software can pose security
            risks for student PII. Such devices could contain malware that steals user credentials and exposes
            student PII.
        </li>
    </ul>

        privacy policy on the Site. &nbsp;Your continued use of the Site after any revisions shall constitute your
        acceptance of such changes.</p>
