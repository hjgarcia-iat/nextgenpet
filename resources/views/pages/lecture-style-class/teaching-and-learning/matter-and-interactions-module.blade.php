        <h3>Teaching &amp; Learning &mdash; Module MI Cluster</h3>
        <p>
            Click on the lesson titles below to view or download the lessons in PDF format. The extensions below can be
            found on the <a href="http://nextgenpet.sdsu.edu/extensions/index_tl.html" target="_blank">Teaching &amp;
                Learning Extensions page</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Teaching and Learning lesson and extension in the Module MI (Matter and Interactions) cluster is listed
            below, along with a brief summary, the NGSS alignment, estimated class time needed (for lessons) and the
            format (for extensions), and the pre-requisite TL activities (if any). Below each description is a
            suggestion for when you should conduct the in-class lesson or assign the extension. There is a list of the
            NGSS science and engineering practices and the crosscutting concepts following the table. </p>
        <p>
            Note that Extension O is a group project involving working with children. This project typically takes 2-3
            weeks from initial assignment to the time the final individual and group reports are turned in. Although the
            physical science content (physical changes of matter) is associated with Unit PC, by the time students are
            done with the project, the class will (probably) be on a different unit. Thus, the follow-up Lesson 11,
            where students reflect on their interactions with the children they interviewed, will not be connected to
            your current unit. </p>
