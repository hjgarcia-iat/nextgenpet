        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The <em>Studio-style class (SC)</em> version is appropriate if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students can work in groups at tables and perform experiments</li>

            <li>Enrollment is less than approximately 35 students</li>
            <li>The class meets approximately 75 hours/semester, typically in 2.5-hour sessions</li>
            <li>Suitable equipment is available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        During each period students work in small groups to make predictions, perform experiments, make sense of their observations, draw conclusions, and share their ideas with the rest of the class (often using white boards). They record observations and answer questions on worksheets. The instructor usually circulates among the groups, addressing questions, and structures the whole class discussions.

        <strong>Content Modules</strong> has a drop-down menu with links to each of the five content modules in the curriculum. Choosing a module takes you to a page showing graphic displays of the sequence of activities and homework extensions for each unit in the module. Clicking on any of the activities or extensions in these graphics opens a pop-up window that provides a brief description and links to relevant information and instructor materials.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Student Materials</strong> is a viewable-only version of the entire set of student curriculum materials for the ten content units. To order materials for your class, you need to click on the link at the top of the page. (Because of its size [47 MB], this PDF file will take some time to load.

        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Demonstration Movies and Simulations</strong> takes you to a page where you can link to movies that students view or instructors show during activities, or link to simulations used during some activities. The movies are organized by module, unit, and activity; each activity page contains all the movies for that activity.
        </p>
        <p>
