        <p>
        The
        <em>Next Gen PET</em> materials are aligned with the physical science disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices in the National Research Council (NRC) K-12 Science Education Framework and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The tables below provide more information on this alignment.
        <em>Next Gen PET</em> students will be prepared for teaching elementary-level science in alignment with the NGSS. However,
        <em>Next Gen PET</em> can be used to prepare teachers for teaching with any state standards that include a focus on both science content and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Next Gen PET</em> consists of five modules: (1) Module MSE: Developing Models for Magnetism and Static Electricity; (2) Module IE: Interactions and Energy; (3) Module IF: Interactions and Forces; (4) Module WSL: Waves, Sound and Light; and (5) Module MI: Matter and Interactions. Each module includes two engineering design activities requiring application of the moduleâ€™s physical science content.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Teaching & Learning Activities (see Overview link) explicitly address the Science and Engineering Practices and the Crosscutting Concepts.
