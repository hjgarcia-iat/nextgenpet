    <h4>Developers of previous versions</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Next Gen PET</em> was adapted from four previous curricula: <em>Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET)</em>,
        <em>Physical Science and Everyday Thinking (PSET)</em>, <em>Learning Physical Science (LPS)</em>, and <em>Learning
            Physics (LEP)</em>. Several of the activities in <em>Next Gen PET</em> are very similar to the activities
        included in the previous curricula. The co-authors of PET, PSET, LPS and/or LEP who are not co-authors of <em>Next
            Gen PET</em> are listed below since their contributions are reflected in the revised materials.
