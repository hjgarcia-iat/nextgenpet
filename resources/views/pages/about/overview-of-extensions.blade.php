        <em>Next Gen PET</em>
        includes extensions (homework) to support the in-class activities. Extensions are computer-based and include narrative text; simulations; videos of demonstrations, experiments or simulations; and questions with feedback. Most extensions provide practice using the ideas introduced in class, and a few explore new, but related, ideas. Most students will need about 30 minutes to conscientiously work through extensions of average length.

        Extensions are available in Adobe Flash or HTML5 and can be accessed online. Links to the extensions can be included in the course webpage, typically as part of a learning management system (LMS) such as Blackboard or Moodle. Questions within the extensions provide feedback to students but are not graded. Several additional multiple-choice questions are provided for each extension; instructors can use these questions to build an online quiz in their LMS. Most LMSs can be set to automatically score, record, and give feedback.

        All the online extensions are available from the 'Extensions Index' link on the Studio Style Class page or the Lecture Style Class page.
