    Join <em>Next Gen PET</em> FOLC, an online community of faculty engaged in course transformation and continued professional development in the context of the Next Generation Physical Science and Everyday Thinking (Next Gen PET) curricular materials.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong><em>Who is behind this effort?</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    With funding from NSF, the NGP community includes a leadership team and plus ten founding faculty. Together we have extensive experience with teaching PET/PSET/LPS, curriculum and professional development, instructional technology, assessment, research on teaching and learning, and dissemination / faculty change.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The leadership team includes:
    </p>
    <p>
    Edward Price, Cal State San Marcos <br> Fred Goldberg, San Diego State University <br> Steve Robinson, Tennessee Tech
    <br> Chandra Turpen, University of Maryland, College Park <br>Paula Engelhardt, Tennessee Tech <br>Melissa Dancy, University of Colorado, Boulder
    </p>
    

    <p><strong><em>What will the faculty community do?</em></strong></p>
    <p>Lead faculty will mentor clusters of 4-5 faculty. Together, the faculty community will document implementation strategies, challenges, and lessons learned. Each cluster will engage in its own action research projects, meet regularly via videoconference, communicate and collaborate using online tools, and meet in person at conferences and workshops. </p>

    <p><strong><em>Who should consider participating?</em></strong></p>
    <p>Faculty who regularly teach a physics or physical science course for pre-service elementary teachers (in either lecture or studio format); are committed to student-centered, active learning pedagogy; and can commit to actively participating in the community.</p>
