                without notice to You by posting a revised version on www.iat.com or elsewhere on the IAT Website and/or

            All Disputes Shall be Governed by New York Law and Decided by Binding Arbitration. Any and all disputes
            between You and IAT shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and
            to be performed therein without regard to conflicts of laws principles, and shall be decided by binding
            arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association within Westchester County, in the State of
            New York. You and IAT hereby agree to have all disputes between You and IAT decided by a single arbitrator
            in an arbitration proceeding administered by the American Arbitration Association under the American
            Arbitration Association's Expedited Commercial Procedures then in effect. The arbitrator shall conduct all
            arbitration hearings and proceedings in Westchester County, in the State of New York. Determinations and/or
            decisions rendered by the arbitrator pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing, shall be adjudicated in
            accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without consideration of choice of laws, and shall be
            final and binding upon the parties hereto. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
            in any court having jurisdiction thereof. IAT shall be entitled to seek and/or to obtain a temporary and/or
            permanent restraining order from the American Arbitration Association on an expedited and/or emergency
            basis, either upon notice or ex-parte (without notice), without the need to post a bond. Each party shall
            bear the costs of his/her/its own legal fees and expenses. All fees charged by the arbitrator and/or by the
            American Arbitration Association, other than the initial filing fee, shall be shared equally by You and IAT.
            The award of the arbitrator may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The award shall include
            written explanations for all legal and factual determinations.

            <h4>Class Action Waiver</h4>
            <p>Arbitration shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any dispute or claim to be
                arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative
                capacity on behalf of others. The arbitrator's authority to resolve and make written awards is limited
                to claims between You and IAT alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in
                writing by You and IAT. No arbitration award or decision shall have any preclusive effect as to issues
                or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any
                other provision herein, if any portion of this class action waiver provision is deemed invalid or
                unenforceable, then the arbitration provisions set forth in paragraph 14 shall not apply, and in that
                event disputes between You and IAT shall instead be adjudicated in State or Federal Court within
                Westchester County in the State of New York, and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.</p>
